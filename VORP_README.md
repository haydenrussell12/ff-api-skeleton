# VORP (Value Over Replacement Player) System

## Overview

The VORP system calculates **Value Over Replacement Player** scores for fantasy football players using median projections as the replacement level for each position group. This provides a data-driven approach to player valuation that automatically adjusts to the quality of each position group in a given year.

## What is VORP?

**VORP = Player Projected Points - Position Median**

- **Positive VORP**: Player is above replacement level (better than median)
- **Negative VORP**: Player is below replacement level (worse than median)
- **Higher positive VORP**: More valuable relative to position

## Key Features

### üéØ **Fantasy-Relevant Replacement Level**
Instead of using all players (including those who won't make rosters), we use **fantasy-relevant player pools** to establish meaningful replacement levels:

- **QB**: Top 32 players (starter + some backups)
- **RB**: Top 70 players (RB2 + benches)  
- **WR**: Top 80 players (WR2 + benches)
- **TE**: Top 24 players (starter + some backups)
- **K**: Top 32 players (starter + some backups)
- **DEF**: Top 32 players (starter + some backups)

### üìä **Data-Driven Approach**
- Automatically adjusts to position group quality each year
- More accurate than fixed replacement levels
- Reflects actual talent distribution among fantasy-relevant players
- Prevents skewing from deep bench players who won't contribute

### üîÑ **Flexible Integration**
- Works with existing consolidated data structure
- Can be easily extended for weekly projections
- Supports multiple scoring formats

## Usage

### 1. Calculate VORP Scores

```bash
npm run calculate-vorp
```

This will:
- Load consolidated player data
- Calculate position medians
- Generate VORP scores for all players
- Save results to `data/consolidated/player-vorp-scores.json`
- Create summary in `data/consolidated/vorp-summary.json`

### 2. Test VORP Calculation

```bash
npm run test-vorp
```

Runs VORP calculation with sample data to verify functionality.

### 3. Upload to Supabase

```bash
npm run upload-vorp
```

Uploads calculated VORP scores to Supabase database.

## Data Structure

### Input: Consolidated Player Data
```json
{
  "players": [
    {
      "player_id": "jamarr chase",
      "full_name": "Ja'Marr Chase",

          "yds": "1250"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Output: VORP Scores
```json
{
  "playerId": "jamarr chase",
  "playerName": "Ja'Marr Chase",
  "position": "WR",
