# üèà Fantasy Football League Linking & Keeper Analysis

## üöÄ **What's New**

We've added **League Linking** functionality to connect to your **Sleeper** and **ESPN** leagues and analyze keeper decisions! This feature allows you to:

- **Connect to Sleeper leagues** using your league ID
- **Connect to ESPN leagues** using your league ID and season
- **Import team rosters** from last season
- **Get keeper recommendations** based on current ADP vs. draft position
- **Analyze team value** for the upcoming season

## üîó **How to Connect Your League**

### **Step 1: Find Your League ID**

#### **Sleeper Leagues:**
1. Go to your Sleeper league in a web browser
2. Look at the URL: `https://sleeper.com/league/YOUR_LEAGUE_ID`
3. Copy the `YOUR_LEAGUE_ID` part

#### **ESPN Leagues:**
1. Go to your ESPN league in a web browser
2. Look at the URL: `https://fantasy.espn.com/league/YOUR_LEAGUE_ID`
3. Copy the `YOUR_LEAGUE_ID` part
4. Note the season (e.g., 2023, 2024)

### **Step 2: Connect to League**
1. Navigate to **League Manager** (new tab in the navigation)
2. Select your platform (**Sleeper** or **ESPN**)
3. **For ESPN**: Select the season (2022, 2023, or 2024)
4. Paste your league ID
5. Click **"Connect to League"**

### **Step 3: Import Rosters**
1. After connecting, click **"Import Team Rosters"**
2. This will pull all teams and players from the selected season
3. Wait for the import to complete

### **Step 4: Analyze Keepers**
1. Select a team from the dropdown
2. View keeper recommendations based on:
   - **Current ADP** (from Sleeper)
   - **Position value** (RB > WR > TE > QB > K/DST)
   - **Keeper value score** (0-100)

## üìä **Keeper Recommendation Logic**

The system analyzes each player and provides recommendations:

- **DEFINITE KEEPER** (Score 80-100): Elite players with high ADP
- **STRONG KEEPER** (Score 60-79): Valuable players worth keeping
- **CONSIDER KEEPING** (Score 40-59): Borderline cases
- **WEAK KEEPER** (Score 20-39): Probably not worth keeping
- **DON'T KEEP** (Score 0-19): Low-value players

### **Position Multipliers**
- **RB**: 1.2x (Most valuable as keepers)
- **WR**: 1.1x (Very valuable)
- **TE**: 1.0x (Neutral)
- **QB**: 0.8x (Less valuable)
- **K/DST**: 0.3-0.5x (Least valuable)
